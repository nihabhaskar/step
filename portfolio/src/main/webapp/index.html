            <p> Hello! My name is Niha and I am from San Diego and am now a rising 3rd year at the University of California, San Diego. On campus I am a tutor in the CSE department, an active SWE member, and a yoga instructor. I love traveling to National Parks, I have been to 35, and it is on my bucket list to visit them all. I also enjoy tasting and making my own ice cream and love experimenting with weird flavor combinations. In my free time you will probably find me drinking kombucha, hiking, snorkeling, cooking, and spending time with my friends & family.</p>

                <p>Almounds is an application designed for the Central California Almond Growers Association (CCAGA) in order to make the lives of workers and administrators exponentially easier and more organized by streamlining tasks that are normally done by hand. The application offers a dynamic grid that allows for updates pending the filling and emptying of stockpiles, utilizing an algorithm that optimizes resources when a dropoff location is obtained for a truckload, and providing an all-in-one organized user interface for the workers and administrators at CCAGA.</p>

                <h1>Investigation of AFRINIC IPv4 Address Theft</h1>
                <h2>Early Research Scholars Program</h2>
                <p>During ERSP, we conducted an experiment that analyzed shifts of IPv4 addresses away from Africa to identify organizations that may be misappropriating unused AFRINIC IPv4 addresses. We were able to conduct multiple experiments to explore the properties that make an IP address considered suspicious by gathering and comparing data from 3 datasets: Delegation files, BGP Data, and WHOIS data. Using the information from each dataset, we were able to first create scripts that analyzed address blocks that should be in Africa and then determined, through the BGP data announcements who the actual owner of the address block was and if verify if it was truly in use in Africa.</p>
